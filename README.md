# Intro to Tezos Course

These are the exercises to go along with the freeCodeCamp Tezos course. Each folder inside of examples represents one section of the course. Some of the contracts in this course evolved over the course of many lessons so the files keep the same name across folders to make it easy to see the evolution of those contracts.
